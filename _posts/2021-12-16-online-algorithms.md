title: What is an online algorithm?
---

Online algorithms deal with optimization problems with imperfect knowledge of the future

## A more precise mathematical definition
- Request sequence
- Does not capture all problems

## How good is your algorithm?

- competitive ratio

## Example of an online problem: Caching

- something everyone knows
