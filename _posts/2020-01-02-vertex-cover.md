title: The bounded degree vertex cover problem
---

The bounded degree vertex cover problem is a variation of the vertex cover problem, which is a well studied problem in the field of parametrized complexity. Some applications include use cases in cyber security and in efficient dynamic detection of race conditions.

# What is the vertex cover problem?

This problem comes from graph theory, where in a graph G = (V,E), where V is a set of vertices and E is a set of edges, we want a subset of the V such that all edges in E is connected to a vertex from the subset. This subset is called a vertex cover. 

Now everyone can construct a random subset of an arbitrary size, but we want the smallest possible subset that is still a vertex cover. To be more precise this is the minimum vertex problem.

# The bounded degree vertex cover problem

This is a variation of the original problem where the degree of vertex is bounded by a fixed constant. The degree of a vertex means the number of edges that are connected to a vertex (in a undirected graph).
