This is just a test that no one should actually read. This is nothing but rambling to test if everything works as it should.

If anyone is actually still reading, just stop, you're wasting your time...

Syntax highlighting:

Python:
```python
def whatever(something)
    print(something, " or whatever")
```

Java:
```java
public class Test{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("what a test");
    }
}
```
but how do i write small headlines?

### Conclusion:

ayy things are working
